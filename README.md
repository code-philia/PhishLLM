## Introduction
Existing reference-based phishing detection:

- :x: Relies on a pre-defined reference list
- :x: Does not fully utilize the textual information present on the webpage

In our PhishLLM, we build a reference-based phishing detection framework:

- âœ… Without a pre-defined reference list
- âœ… Fully explainable, as it mirrors the human cognitive process during web interaction and provides natural language explanations at every step

## Framework
<img src="./figures/phishllm.png">

- Step 1: Brand recognition model
  - Input: logo caption, Logo OCR Results, industry sector (optional)
  - Intermediate Output: LLM's predicted brand
  - Output: Validated predicted brand, confirmed through Google Images
  
- Step 2: Credential-Requiring-Page classification model
  - Input: webpage OCR results
  - Output: LLM chooses from A. Credential-Taking Page or B. Non-Credential-Taking Page
  
- Step 3.1: CRP transition model (activate if LLM chooses 'B' from the last step)
  - Input: webpage clickable UI elements (the webpage must be live)
  - Intermediate Output: most likely UI element being a login button
  - Output: The page after clicking the UI 
  
- Step 3.2: 
  - Case 1: If the domain is from a web hosting domain: it is flagged as phishing if
    (i) LLM predicts a targeted brand inconsistent with the webpage's domain
  and  (ii) LLM chooses 'A' from Step 2
  
  - Case 2: If the domain is not from a web hosting domain: it is flagged as phishing if
  (i) LLM predicts a targeted brand inconsistent with the webpage's domain
  (ii) LLM chooses 'A' from Step 2
  and (iii) the domain is not a popular domain indexed by Google

## Project structure
```
|_ brand_recognition
|_ selection_model (i.e. credential-requiring-page classification model)
|_ ranking_model
|_ model_chain (chaining all the components)
  |_ test_llm.py: main class
|_ field_study

```

## Setup
- Step 1: Clone the Repository and Install Requirements
```bash
    cd PhishLLM/
    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
```
- Step 2: Register OpenAI API Key. See [OpenAI Official Docs](https://platform.openai.com/). Save the API key to './datasets/openai_key2.txt'.
- Step 3: Create a Google Cloud Service Account
  - Go to [Google Cloud Console]((https://console.cloud.google.com/)) and set up billing details.
  - Create a project and enable the "Custom Search API".
  - Obtain the API Key and Search Engine ID for "Custom Search API" following this [guide](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).
  - Create a blank text file in the directory "./datasets/google_api_key.txt" and paste your API Key and Search Engine ID as follows:
     ```text 
      [YOUR_API_KEY]
      [YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID]
     ```
- Step 4 (Optional): Edit Hyperparameters. All hyperparameter configurations are stored in param_dict.yaml. Edit this file to experiment with different parameter combinations.
- Step 5: 
  - Run PhishLLM 
  ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    python -m field_study.test --folder [folder to test, e.g., ./datasets/field_study/2023-08-21/] --date [e.g., 2023-08-21]
  ```
  - Or run baseline methods
  ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    python -m field_study.test_baseline --folder [folder to test] --date [e.g., 2023-08-21] --method [phishpedia|phishintention|dynaphish]
  ```
